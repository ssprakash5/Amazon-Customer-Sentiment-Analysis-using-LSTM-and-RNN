Project Title: Customer Sentiment Tracking in E-commerce: A Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach
Project Overview: In this project, you will develop a sophisticated system to track and analyze customer sentiment over time in an e-commerce environment. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning methods, you will process large volumes of customer data, including reviews, comments, and feedback, to gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction and product trends.
Skills and Technologies Utilized:
•	Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing)
•	Deep Learning (Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers)
•	Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
•	Data Preprocessing and Analysis
•	Data Visualization
•	Sentiment Analysis
•	Time Series Analysis
•	Web Scraping (if necessary)
Project Objectives:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
•	Gather historical customer data from the e-commerce site, including customer reviews, ratings, and timestamps.
•	Clean and preprocess the data, including text cleaning and feature engineering.
2.	Sentiment Analysis Model (Machine Learning):
•	Develop a machine learning model, such as a supervised classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) or a deep learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer), to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
•	Train the model to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.
3.	Time Series Analysis of Sentiment Trends:
•	Apply time series analysis techniques to track changes in customer sentiment over time.
•	Visualize sentiment trends using time-series plots, allowing stakeholders to observe how sentiment evolves.
4.	Deep Learning for Sentiment Trends (Optional):
•	Experiment with deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformers, to capture complex temporal dependencies in customer sentiment data.
•	Train a model to predict future sentiment trends based on historical data.
5.	Dashboard and Reporting:
•	Create an interactive dashboard that provides real-time sentiment analysis and historical sentiment trend visualizations.
•	Generate reports with insights and recommendations for the e-commerce platform to improve customer satisfaction.
Expected Outcomes:
•	Accurate sentiment analysis models capable of classifying customer sentiment.
•	Visualizations and insights into customer sentiment trends over time.
•	An interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring of customer sentiment.
Impact:
•	Improved understanding of customer sentiment and its changes over time.
•	Opportunities for proactive response to negative sentiment trends, such as product improvements or customer service enhancements.
•	Enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to increased sales and growth for the e-commerce site.
